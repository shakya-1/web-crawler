Neighboring country Italy has confirmed about 655 cases of coronavirus until today morning, FOPH said.\n",

      "Maurice Turrettini, Chairman of the Foundation Board said, “We regret this situation, but the health of all participants is our and our exhibitors' top priority. This is a case of force majeure and a tremendous loss for the manufacturers who have invested massively in their presence in Geneva. However, we are convinced that they will understand this decision.\"\n",
